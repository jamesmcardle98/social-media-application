# social-media-application
**Project Overview:**
This iOS application was created as part of my final year thesis, addressing the need for a more secure and non-editable platform for sharing photos and memories. With privacy and authenticity at its core, our app provides a safe and trustworthy environment for users to share their cherished moments.

The idea behind this project came from the unrealistic beauty standards that are set by today's "influencers" that can be very damaging to their viewers, in which doctored images are posted and portrayed as "real". I propose a solution to this problem, a mobile application (iOS) for sharing non-edited photos with one another. The application will be designed as a social media platform where users can upload photos inside the application (user input), the user input will then undergo a vetting process using a Modified Image Recognition (M.I.R) algorithm to check if the input has been edited. Only non-edited images will be permitted for sharing.

**Key Features:**

**Non-Editable Photos:** Photos uploaded to the app are protected from editing, ensuring the authenticity of shared content.
**User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login processes to safeguard user data.
**Real-time Photo Sharing:** Seamlessly share photos with friends and followers in real-time.
**Privacy Settings:** Customize privacy preferences to control who can view and interact with your photos.
**User Profiles:** Create personal profiles with bio and profile picture for a personalized experience.
**Notifications:** Stay updated with real-time notifications for likes, comments, and more.
**User Engagement:** Interact with others through likes, comments, and direct messaging.
**Search Functionality:** Discover new friends and content through a robust search feature.

**Tech Stack:**

**Swift:** The primary programming language for iOS app development, ensuring efficiency and performance.
**Google Firebase:** A scalable, real-time database and authentication system that powers the backend of the application.
**UIKit:** The fundamental framework for building the app's user interface, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
**CocoaPods:** Dependency manager for integrating third-party libraries seamlessly.
